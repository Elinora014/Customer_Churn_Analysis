# Introduction 
Customer retention is a critical challenge for financial institutions, particularly in a competitive and evolving banking landscape. High customer churn rates can lead to significant revenue losses and weakened brand loyalty, making it imperative for banks to understand and address the underlying causes. In this analysis, we explore customer churn for a Canadian bank that has partnered with Datafied Technologies to gain deeper insights into attrition patterns. Leveraging Power BI for exploratory data analysis, we will uncover key demographic and behavioral factors influencing customer decisions. By identifying patterns and trends within the bank's churn database, this study aims to provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention, improve satisfaction, and ultimately support long-term business growth.


# Problem Statement

A Canadian bank struggling with customer churn partnered with Datafied Technologies to address the issue. The bank lacked insights into why customers were leaving, impacting satisfaction and revenue. To identify key churn factors, they provided a dataset of 10,000 customers over six months for analysis.
